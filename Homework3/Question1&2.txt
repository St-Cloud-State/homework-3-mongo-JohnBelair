1. Explain how this enhancement can be achieved by supplementing our previous
application with a document database. Describe how the form of a document will be
modified as we perform each enhancement.

-In a document database we can add this notes enhancement by using the JSON formated documents typically used in a document database. We can start of with a basic document that adds a name and address to the document when it created and has other details like status and messages. 
-Then for the processing phase we can have a messages for each subphase depending on the state of the subphase.
-If the application is accepted we can add loan terms to the document.
-If the application is rejected we can add a reason why.
-When we look-up each document we display each message regardless of location since it is all located on the same document.

2. Describe how you will use the Mongo commands to achieve these modifications.

-To add new documents we can use the .insertOne command to add a new document.
-To update the documents throughout the processing phase, with acceptance or rejection and with any messages that need to be added we can use the .updateOne command.
-To query the document database for the document with a specific ID we can use the .findOne command.
